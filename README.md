# land_MPU6050
This project deals with the capture of the type of soil in which civil works can be built, for this an MPU6050 sensor is used together with arduino and python.
# Description
MPU6050 is basically a sensor for motion processing devices. It is the world first six dimension motions tracking device. It was designed for low cost and high performances smartphones, tablets and wearable sensor. It is capable of processing nine-axis algorithms, it captures motion in X, Y and Z axis at the same time. MPU6050 is used in different industrial projects and electronic devices to control and detect the 3-D motion of different objects. In today's post, we will have a look at its working, pinout, protocol, it's interfacing with Arduino, features, applications, etc.
